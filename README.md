## About
FarmControl is a Bukkit plugin that allows you to control certain properties of farms on your server.

**Features**:
* Disable breeding in oversized animal farms and villager breeders.
* Reduce unnecessary random movement within mob farms.
* Disable the AI of mobs in farms.
* Limit the number of entities allowed in an area.
* Highly configurable - allowing you to tailor the plugin to your needs.
* Low impact - with the brunt of the plugin's processing performed asynchronously.
